# spelling_phoneme
Spelling_phoneme is a static website with an explanation and  visualisation
about the way different languages map their sounds to spelling systems.

People talk about how 'phonetic' a given language is, or why English spelling
is so much worse than, say, Polish or Italian.

This visualisation, written using D3.js, demonstrates what people are really
talking about when they say a language is 'phonetic' or otherwise, and just
how bad English spelling is compared to a few other languages.

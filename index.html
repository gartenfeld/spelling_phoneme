			<h1>Spelling to Phoneme Mappings</h1>
			<p>
				People always talk about how 'phonetic' a given language is, or what it is about English spelling that is so much worse than, say, Polish or Italian. Here, I've made a visualisation using D3.js to try to demonstrate what people are really talking about when they say a language is 'phonetic' or otherwise, and just how bad English spelling is compared to a few other languages.
			</p>
			<div id="example_1" class="d3_content"></div>
			<div id="example_2" class="d3_content"></div>
			<div id="polish_vowels" class="d3_content"></div>
			<div id="italian_vowels" class="d3_content"></div>
			<div id="german_vowels" class="d3_content"></div>
			<div id="english_vowels" class="d3_content"></div>
			<p>
				These diagrams have been generated automatically using D3.js from data files which are simply lists of spelling to phoneme mappings. If you'd like a language to be included here and you have the knowledge to create a list of spelling to phoneme mappings for me to feed in to my program, I'd be very happy to create a similar diagram for your language.
